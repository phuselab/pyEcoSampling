def compute_complexity(histmat, N, n_bins):
    """Computes spatial configuration complexity $$ C(t)$$ of Interest points.

    The function is a simple wrapper for complexity computation.
    Executes some kind of complexity algorithm which is defined from the
    parameter c_type by calling the appropriate function.

    Args:
        c_type (string): Chosen complexity method.
        histmat (matrix): 2D Spatial histogram of IPs.
        N (float): number of points.
        n_bins (float): number of bins.

    Returns:
        disorder (float): Disorder value.
        order (float): Order value.
        complexity (float): Space complexity value.

    Examples:
        >>> disorder, order, compl = esComputeComplexity('SDL', histmat, N, n_bins)
